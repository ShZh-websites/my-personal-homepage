# Tips

- For key image like avatar which may impact your layout, just **embed it in HTML**.
- Always **shrink your images** and encoding it with new generation image format like **AVIF**.
- When user's browser not supporting AVIF, just choose PNG format or whatever **as the fallback**.
- Choose **image storage** like [cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) to get benefit of its powerful CDN.
- Repersent **low resolution images first** when user's network is slow.
